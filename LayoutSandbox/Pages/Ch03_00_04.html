It’s going to use 100 machine screws, each of which will have two nuts on it (so you’ll need 200 nuts). You could count these all out one by one, but there is a much faster way of counting lots of small things. You can do it just by weighing them.</p></div>

		<p>If you want 100 screws, all you have to do is calculate how much 100 screws would weigh, then add them to the scale until you reach that weight.</p>
		<p>Nuts are lighter than screws, and 200 nuts actually weigh less than 100 screws, even though there are twice as many nuts. Greater weight does not necessarily mean a larger number of items.</p>

		<p class="chapter-head">MASS VS. WEIGHT</p>
		<div class="bodytext">
		<p>People normally say that when you weigh something, you are measuring its weight. But you are also measuring its <i>mass</i>. A brick that reads 6 kilos on a scale has a mass of six kilos. If you take it to the moon, it will only weigh about 1 kilo, because gravity on the moon is about 1/6<sup>th</sup> as strong as on earth. But it will still have a mass of 6 kilos. People (including scientists) very often use the word “weight” when they really mean mass. Most of the time this is fine and causes no problems. But we’re going to be careful in what follows to use “mass” when we mean mass.</p>
