	<p class="chapter-head">Chapter 3: Count Your Stuff</p>

	<p>In this book so far we have talked about chemical substances and the transformations they undergo, but we have not gotten into a lot of numbers and measurements. We told you that methane reacts with oxygen, but how much methane reacts with how much oxygen?</p>
	<p>In this chapter we are going to give you the tools and the insight you need to calculate the quantities of chemicals involved in reactions. This knowledge is crucial to all practical chemistry. It’s what tells you <i>how much</i> of each chemical to measure out, and <i>how much</i> product to expect. It’s what lets you calculate if one fuel will generate more pollution than another. It’s what lets you weigh the air and count the atoms in every breath.</p>

	<p>Here again is the balanced chemical reaction for the combustion of methane, copied from the last chapter.</p>

	<p>CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) is important these days because of its impact on the environment. Suppose you’re working on this problem, and you want to know how much CO<sub>2</sub> will be produced by burning a certain amount of methane (say in the power plant shown below).</p>

	<p>All you have to do is look at the reaction and see that you get one molecule of CO<sub>2</sub> for each molecule of methane. So if you have a billion molecules of methane, you’ll get a billion molecules of CO<sub>2</sub> (plus two billion molecules of water).</p>

	<p>Problem solved!</p>

	<p>Except, not really, because “one billion molecules of methane” isn’t a quantity you can really do anything with. How much does it weigh? How big a volume would it take up? Is that a lot of methane or hardly any?</p>

	<p>When you buy methane (also called natural gas) from the gas company, you don’t pay for it by the molecule. You pay for it by the cubic foot (or cubic meter). When you buy gasoline, you buy it by the gallon or liter. When you buy coal, you buy it by the pound, kilogram, or ton. You can’t buy anything by the molecule.</p>

	<p>We need a way to bridge the world of chemical reaction expressions with the practical world of weights and measures. What would be really useful is a way to count molecules by weighing them, or by measuring the volume they take up.</p>

		<p class="caption">Electric power plants that run on natural gas (methane) are called  “peaker plants” because they are switched on only during periods of maximum electric power usage (for example, on hot summer afternoons when many people turn on their air conditioners). These generators are cheap to build, but expensive to operate, so power companies build enough of them to make sure they can handle peak demand, but then only operate them when they really need to. (On the other hand, nuclear power plants (see Chapter XXX), are expensive to build, but cheap to operate, so they are run as much as possible to generate the baseline amount of power needed all the time.)</p>
